#+TITLE:WebExtensions API support library

Right now, it's just a prototype for loading Scheme-based library into WebKit via WebKitWebExtension infrastructure. Scheme code is
- injected as a C string,
- compiled with libguile,
- and then hooked as callbacks into extension signals

Scheme code implements most of the infrastructure reliable, but it hasn't been tested against the proper WebExtension example yet.

* Building

On Guix, it's enough to:
#+begin_src sh
  guix shell pkg-config glib gobject-introspection webkitgtk guile -- make
  cp -f webextensions.so /path/to/nyxt/gtk-extensions/
#+end_src


* To Do:
- Scheme implementation:
  - [X] Complete JSCore support.
  - [X] Add WebKitWebExtension support.
  - [ ] Glib/GTK primitives, if necessary.
- Common Lisp implementation?
